Features?

It uses Google Map APIs and a knockout framework to display a map with my coffee shop options in San Luis Obispo. 
You can filer different locations by search for there name in the text box. This will display only markers that match the search.
You can click on each marker to open up an Info Window that will provide information of that particular place. The information is gathered from 
foursquare API and parsed with Jquery.
